# Association Rule Mining Using Apriori Algorithm

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook implementation** of the **Apriori algorithm** for association rule mining using a grocery transaction dataset from Kaggle. The implementation showcases how to extract frequent itemsets and generate association rules to uncover hidden patterns in consumer behavior.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. You also need **Jupyter Notebook** and essential libraries to run the Apriori algorithm.

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas mlxtend
   ```

3. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/apriori-algorithm.git
   cd apriori-algorithm
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the `apriori_Implement.ipynb` file and run the code cells.

## Code Implementation
The Jupyter Notebook contains the following steps:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: Reads the grocery transaction data and preprocesses it into a suitable format.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Converts transactional data into a format compatible with the Apriori algorithm.
3. **Applying the Apriori Algorithm**: Uses `mlxtend`'s `apriori` and `association_rules` functions to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
4. **Visualizing the Results**: Displays key association rules with support, confidence, and lift metrics.

## Example Output
After running the notebook, you will obtain **association rules** such as:
```
{milk} → {bread} (Support: 0.08, Confidence: 0.75, Lift: 1.5)
{butter, milk} → {bread} (Support: 0.05, Confidence: 0.85, Lift: 2.0)
```
These rules help in identifying commonly purchased itemsets, aiding in business decision-making.
